# EvolutionSimulation_MachineLearning_NeuralNetwork

The purpose of this project is to bring together my passion for understanding biology and evolution through the combination of a evolution simulator, and a neural network. With the simulator , it pits species against both each other and their enviroment, thereby providing an amount of stress that will effects their survival rate. A neural network is implemented with the given choices of the species, allowing them to learn what is most necessary to learn what is most important towards producing the fittest creature for survival.
